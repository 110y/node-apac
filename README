apac (Amazon Product Advertising Client) will allow you to access the Amazon Product Advertising API. Learn more about the API at https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html.


Install using npm:

    npm install apac@latest

If you try to install without "@latest", it will try to install the most recent stable
version, but there is no stable version yet. So for now you must specify latest.


Here's a quick example:

    var sys = require('sys'),
        OperationHelper = require('apac').OperationHelper;

    var opHelper = new OperationHelper({
        awsId:     '[YOUR AWS ID HERE]',
        awsSecret: '[YOUR AWS SECRET HERE]',
        assocId:   '[YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG HERE]',
    });

    opHelper.execute('ItemSearch', {
        'SearchIndex': 'Books',
        'Keywords': 'harry potter',
        'ResponseGroup': 'ItemAttributes,Offers'
    }, function(error, results) {
        if (error) { sys.print('Error: ' + error + "\n") }
        sys.print("Results:\n" + results + "\n");
    });


The library is pretty slim. It doesn't even parse the XML results yet. It is also very
new and may be unstable. That said, I'm using it without any problems.
