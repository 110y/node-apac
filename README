node-apac - Node.js client for the Amazon Product Advertising API.

apac (Amazon Product Advertising Client) will allow you to access the Amazon Product Advertising API from Node.js. It supports the newly required Request Signatures which can be a bit tedious to generate on your own. Learn more about the API at https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html.


Install using npm:

    npm install apac@latest

If you try to install without "@latest", it will try to install the most recent stable
version, but there is no stable version yet. So for now you must specify latest.


Here is a quick start to help you get node, npm and node-apac installed and running:

Here's a quick example:

    var sys = require('sys'),
        OperationHelper = require('apac').OperationHelper;

    var opHelper = new OperationHelper({
        awsId:     '[YOUR AWS ID HERE]',
        awsSecret: '[YOUR AWS SECRET HERE]',
        assocId:   '[YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG HERE]',
    });

    opHelper.execute('ItemSearch', {
        'SearchIndex': 'Books',
        'Keywords': 'harry potter',
        'ResponseGroup': 'ItemAttributes,Offers'
    }, function(error, results) {
        if (error) { sys.print('Error: ' + error + "\n") }
        sys.print("Results:\n" + sys.inspect(results) + "\n");
    });

Results are returned as a JSON object (XML results parsed using xml2js -- thanks pierrel).

The library is pretty slim. It is also very new and may be unstable. That said, I'm using
it without any problems.
